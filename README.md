 Creating a new account wether it's for social media, online shopping, or paying your bills online can be be frustrating. Every year, the requirements that need to be met before creating an account has been constantly changing. In most cases, creating a username is relatively easy as you would only need to put your email address. Creating a password, on the hand, has been a headache for most people as it requires more informations such as adding special characters, numbers, lowercase, uppercase letters, and many more. Fortunately, I have came up with a solution. I have created a web program that allows users to create a password in less than 10 seconds.
